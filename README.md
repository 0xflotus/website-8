The Caddy Website
=================

This is the source of the Caddy website, [caddyserver.com](https://caddyserver.com).


## Requirements

- Caddy 2 (installed in your PATH as `caddy`)


## Quick start

1. `git clone https://github.com/caddyserver/website.git`
2. `cd website`
3. `caddy run`

Your first time, you may be prompted for a password. This is so Caddy can serve the site over local HTTPS.

You can then load [https://localhost](https://localhost) in your browser.
